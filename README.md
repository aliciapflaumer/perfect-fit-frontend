## Perfect Fit

Perfect Fit is an exercise log app that allows users to keep a schedule of their exercise/workout routine. They can create, update, delete, and get all of their exercises.

## The front end (client)
The front end is written in html, css, handlebars, javascript, jquery

## The back end (server)
The back end is a Rails application supporting 4 RESTful routes for handling GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests of the workouts source.

## Approach to building Perfect Fit
I approached to building this Capstone project similiar to the second project, [GotReads](https://aliciapflaumer.github.io/got-reads-front-end/), because it is where I started to feel comfortable as a developer.
To stay organized, I started with creating my usual checklist and workflow chart. The idea came from my own fitness progress, because on top of using an app to map and track my running, I also keep a pen & paper journal.

## Wishlist

I would like to build an actual run tracker, similar to the big names out there Nike, RunKeeper, and MapMyRun. That'll take some more learning.

## Issues I encountered
A few errors popped up along the way, for which I opened issues for on the queue – and the consultants were good guiding me in the right direction, and helping to solve the problem(s). One though was troubling, the dreaded 500 server error on localhost – that I encountered similiarly during project 2 – I filed an issue but I troubleshooted and solved on my own, documenting my progress along the way – in 5 hours.
